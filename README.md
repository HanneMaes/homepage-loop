<img src="docs/logo.jpg" width="344px" height="94px">

I set this as my homepage and it redirects to an url randomly chosen for my list of homepages.

I made this because I wanted different homepages, but I didn't like them to open in multiple tabs.
Now I get a random homepage chosen from my list of preferred homepages every time I launch a new browser window or tab.
